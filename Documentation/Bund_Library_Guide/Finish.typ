= Conclusion

BUND is a very new language. It is currently in its early stages of development, and the language's runtime has many limitations. The standard library requires improvement, and the author or contributor must address several potential bugs. However, the _bundcore_ crate and its dependencies have successfully passed all their test cases, which is a promising sign. Although the language is simple and its underlying dependencies are generally stable, there are no guarantees against critical bugs. The license is attached for reference. While concatenative, stack-based programming languages are not widely used in general programming practices, they have stood the test of time and deserve more attention from the software development community. BUND aims to address design gaps in this concept, and the author hopes to spark interest with his ideas and inspirations that brought BUND into existence.
